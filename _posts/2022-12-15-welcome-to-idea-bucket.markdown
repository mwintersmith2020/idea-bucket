## Welcome to Idea Bucket!

My name is Mark and I'm passionate about building tools which **_delight & empower._**

## --- MARK'S MANIFESTO ---

* A well-designed tool will become a life-long companion.

* Your data is YOUR data and should never be held hostage.

* The best tools don't solve problems for you -- they allow you to solve problems for yourself.

* One database for life: you've got one brain -- so why shouldn't you have one DIGITAL brain?

* Have it your way: most important is the ability to see your own data visualized in your own way.

* If it can be imagined, it can be built.

IdeaBucket is an ongoing development effort built to realize these aspirations -- swiss-army knife for your life's most important data.

Detailed use-cases will follow.  In the meantime, join my mailing list and be the FIRST to know when a new feature is about to drop!
